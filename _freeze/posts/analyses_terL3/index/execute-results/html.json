Vous pouvez les utiliser pour réaliser des analyses avec le logiciel JASP par exemple.\n\nDernier point : le code R qui sert à réaliser les opérations sur les données, à réaliser les tests statistiques, et à générer la figure est par défaut caché (et utilisé pour générer automatiquement les éléments de résultats rapportés). Pour le consulter (le code est en grande partie annoté), vous pouvez cliquer sur `Cliquer ici pour voir le code R` quand cette expression apparaît plus bas).\n\n## Participants\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Load (or install and load) packages\nrequire(pacman)\np_load('tidyverse', 'dplyr', 'psych')\n\n# read the data file\ndat = read.csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# table(dat$consent)\n# table(dat$serious)\n# table(dat$pay_attention)\n\n#Socio-demographic information\nsociodemo = read.csv(\"sociodemographic_information.csv\")\n\nsociodemo = sociodemo %>% filter(Status==\"APPROVED\")\ntab_sex = as.matrix(table(sociodemo$Sex)/219)\n#describe(sociodemo$Age)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSur les 220 participants qui ont participé à l'étude (sur la plateforme Prolific, étude en ligne ; les participants étaient rémunérés), nous avons collecté les données complètes de 219 participants (50$\\%$ femmes; $M_{âge} =$ 38.77 ; $SD_{âge} =$ 15.21). Aucun participant n'était à exclure sur base des critères d'exclusion préenregistrés (déclaration de réponses au hasard ; déclaration de ne pas avoir fait attention aux consignes ou aux affirmations).\n\n## Constitution du jeu de données pour les analyses\n\nVoir le code `R` pour la constitution du jeu de données pour les analyses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Retrieve

De façon intéressante, la proportion de jugements 'fake news' était **inférieure** pour les affirmations répétées ($M =$ 0.41 ; $SD =$ 0.15) par rapport à nouvelles ($M =$ 0.44 ; $SD =$ 0.15).
